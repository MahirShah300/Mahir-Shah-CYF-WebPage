<p1>Grimgor Ironhide is one of the most feared and iconic Legendary Lords in Total War: Warhammer III, embodying the raw, unstoppable brutality of the Greenskins. As the greatest Black Orc to ever live, Grimgor cares for only one thing: fighting the biggest and strongest enemies he can find, and proving beyond all doubt that he is da best. Cunning, subtlety, and diplomacy mean nothing to him. Strength is the only language he respects.
  <br><br>
  On the campaign map, Grimgor leads his faction with an aggressive, momentum-driven playstyle. His presence encourages constant warfare, rewarding players who stay on the offensive and keep the <strong>Waaagh!</strong> rolling. Grimgor excels at smashing enemy lines head-on, making him ideal for players who enjoy direct conquest rather than careful political manoeuvring. His faction bonuses favour powerful infantry and relentless expansion, perfectly reflecting his personality and lore.
  <br><br>
  In battle, Grimgor is a walking catastrophe. Armed with the legendary axe Gitsnik, he carves through elite units and monstrous foes alike. He thrives in the thick of combat, shrugging off blows that would fell lesser warriors and cutting down heroes and lords with brutal efficiency. When Grimgor is on the field, the Greenskins fight harder simply by following him into the fray.
  <br><br>
  In Total War: Warhammer III, Grimgor represents the purest form of Greenskin warfare: endless fighting, overwhelming force, and total domination through strength alone. He is not a tactician or a ruler in the traditional sense—he is a living weapon, and wherever he marches, the world breaks beneath his boots.
